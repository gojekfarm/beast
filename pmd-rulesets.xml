        <!-- In many places in Apache Commons Math, there are complex boolean expressions.
             We do use extra parentheses there as most people do not recall operator precedence,
             this means even if the parentheses are useless for the compiler, we don't consider
             them useless for the developer. This is the reason why we disable this rule. -->

        <!-- At several places in the optimization package, we set up public "optimize" methods
             that simply call their base class optimize method. This is intentional and allows
             to update the javadoc and make sure the additional parameters implemented at the
             lower class level are properly documented. These new parameters are really taken
             into accound despite we merely call super.optimize because the top level optimze
             methods call a protected parseOptimizationData method implemented in the specialized
             class. This is the reason why we disable this rule. -->
